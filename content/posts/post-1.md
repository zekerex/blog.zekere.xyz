Hi! I've thought about making a blog thousands of times before, but I never actually went through with any of it. I really wanted a good, automated system, and when I was first starting out with webdev stuff on Neocities I manually did everything by hand- which was incredibly tedious and progressively harder to manage as more entries piled up.

After a while with new knowledge I gave all of this another go; originally this blog was coded in PHP / Javascript, rendering HTML in real time... until I realized that everything I wanted to do is already doable with a static site generator (woops, I overcomplicated things yet again!), this when I discovered Hugo.

Hugo is an insanely powerful tool. Like, seriously. I am planning on incooperating this into my workflow ASAP. It's very intutive, has good documentation, and is all-around just... really nice. It's written in Go, too, which means compiling everything is *insanely fast*!


## What are you planning to do with this blog?

I'll mainly post what has been on my mind, or things I find to be interesting (mostly relating to my hobbies), though articles about a specific topic will most likely be it's own page(s)
(Ex: Krita tutorials will be on a future, dedicated "Krita tutorials" page).

I may also occasionally post about what I am considering adding to the site or sneak peaks to future updates- as the time that takes between 
updates have gotten increasingly sparser; I have been busier with life and dealing with quite a bit of mental / physical health issues.



## Will you be making Japanese translations for each post?
As of right now, no, simply because both translating everything would take a lot of time.

Additionally, I am a lot more better at articulating my more complex thoughts in English, which is unfortunate because Japanese is my original, 
native language. I would like to be good at them both equally; I hope that this will eventually change as I have been doing quite a bit 
of re-studying in my own time.

I might make certain posts in Japanese and vice-versa, just not full-translations of each and every post I make. I think 
it would be a massive undertaking regardless of skill level.


That is all for now, 'till next time.
