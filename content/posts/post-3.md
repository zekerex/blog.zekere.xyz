By the time I post on this blog again I will most likely be back in Japan. I haven't seen my family in a while and I'm glad to be seeing them again.

There's a lot of things on my mind, mostly regarding my uncertainty for the future- I guess it's par for the course when you reach this point in your life. 

"Maybe I'll go for an info-sci degree!" I say, "No, maybe comp-sci...actually should I even do college at all?"
I've thought about it long and hard for years- still haven't reached a consensus in my head about it. I guess things will fall into place. We'll see.
