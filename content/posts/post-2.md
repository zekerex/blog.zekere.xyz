I have been getting into 3D Modeling / Rigging as of late after years of wanting to do so. This is a Kirby model I made in a couple of hours. It's 
also fully rigged!

I chose a simple character on purpose. As much as I want to make my OCs 3D #inreallife I don't think my skill level is good enough yet for 
that. I am a huge Kirby fan though... so, why not?
