      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about making a blog thousands of times before, but I never actually went through with any of it. I really wanted a good, automated system, and when I was first starting out with webdev stuff on Neocities I manually did everything by hand- which was incredibly tedious and progressively harder to manage as more entries piled up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while with new knowledge I gave all of this another go; originally this blog was coded in PHP / Javascript, rendering HTML in real time&amp;hellip; until I realized that everything I wanted to do is already doable with a static site generator (woops, I overcomplicated things yet again!), this when I discovered Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
