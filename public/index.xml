      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been getting into 3D Modeling / Rigging as of late after years of wanting to do so. This is a Kirby model I made in a couple of hours. It&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;also fully rigged!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://file.garden/ZWkvNY4S7Xz2vybq/blog.zekere/images/122424.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I chose a simple character on purpose. As much as I want to make my OCs 3D #inreallife I don&amp;rsquo;t think my skill level is good enough yet for&#xA;that. I am a huge Kirby fan though&amp;hellip; so, why not?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about making a blog thousands of times before, but I never actually went through with any of it. I really wanted a good, automated system, and when I was first starting out with webdev stuff on Neocities I manually did everything by hand- which was incredibly tedious and progressively harder to manage as more entries piled up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while with new knowledge I gave all of this another go; originally this blog was coded in PHP / Javascript, rendering HTML in real time&amp;hellip; until I realized that everything I wanted to do is already doable with a static site generator (woops, I overcomplicated things yet again!), this is when I discovered Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
