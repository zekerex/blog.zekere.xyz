  <p>Hi! I&rsquo;ve thought about making a blog thousands of times before, but I never actually went through with any of it. I really wanted a good, automated system, and when I was first starting out with webdev stuff on Neocities I manually did everything by hand- which was incredibly tedious and progressively harder to manage as more entries piled up.</p>
<p>After a while with new knowledge I gave all of this another go; originally this blog was coded in PHP / Javascript, rendering HTML in real time&hellip; until I realized that everything I wanted to do is already doable with a static site generator (woops, I overcomplicated things yet again!), this is when I discovered Hugo.</p>
<p>Hugo is an insanely powerful tool. Like, seriously. I am planning on incooperating this into my workflow ASAP. It&rsquo;s very intutive, has good documentation, and is all-around just&hellip; really nice. It&rsquo;s written in Go, too, which means compiling everything is <em>insanely fast</em>!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-planning-to-do-with-this-blog">What are you planning to do with this blog?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mainly post what has been on my mind, or things I find to be interesting (mostly relating to my hobbies), though articles about a specific topic will most likely be it&rsquo;s own page(s)
(Ex: Krita tutorials will be on a future, dedicated &ldquo;Krita tutorials&rdquo; page).</p>
<p>I may also occasionally post about what I am considering adding to the site or sneak peaks to future updates- as the time that takes between
updates have gotten increasingly sparser; I have been busier with life and dealing with quite a bit of mental / physical health issues.</p>
<h2 id="will-you-be-making-japanese-translations-for-each-post">Will you be making Japanese translations for each post?</h2>
<p>As of right now, no, simply because both translating everything would take a lot of time.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am a lot more better at articulating my more complex thoughts in English, which is unfortunate because Japanese is my original,
native language. I would like to be good at them both equally; I hope that this will eventually change as I have been doing quite a bit
of re-studying in my own time.</p>
<p>I might make certain posts in Japanese and vice-versa, just not full-translations of each and every post I make. I think
it would be a massive undertaking regardless of skill level.</p>
<p>That is all for now, &rsquo;till next time.</p>
